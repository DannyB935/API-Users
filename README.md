# API Users
This API is build using Flask. It just for testing when I want to try another front-end framework and I need some back-end info.

## Modules I've installed into my virtual env
- `Flask`
- `psycopg2`: to connect to postgresql
- `jwt`: for handling sessions
- `python-dotenv`: env variables

I also left a .sql file to restore my DB. The module list could be expanded during the time.
